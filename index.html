<h1>Assignment 2 â€“ Bootstrap</h1>
	<p>Bootstrap was started as an internal project at Twitter and was originally named Twitter Blueprint. It was pioneered by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton but also included other developers within Twitter. The motivation behind the project was to have a single framework that development teams could use to create tools for the organization. At the time there was no consistency with the tools and libraries that were being used for development. As a result, there were higher maintenance costs and issues, along with inconsistent design patterns. The purpose was to remove system and development inconsistencies and provide a common framework for all of the internal tools.</p>

  <p>The original sponsor of the project was Twitter since the project started as an internal project and remained that way for a little over a year. It seems as if the project has now taken on a life of its own and prefers to not be associated with the Twitter brand. There is a list of core contributors on the Bootstrap site but none of them seem to still be employed at Twitter if they ever were in the past. Additionally, there is a large community of contributors to the open-source project. </p>
	<p>GitHub is used extensively by the project. The issue tracker feature of GitHub is used as the primary location for reporting bugs, requesting features, or submitting pull requests to submit code to the project. In the issue tracker they also use a set of labels to help with keeping things organized. They provide a list of the labels and their meaning and purpose. Guidelines are provided by the core developer team as well for the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and bug reports. In addition, they use a bot to check code in the issue tracker to validate HTML and comment on posts that have HTML issues. There are also bots that assist in checking all pull requests for common mistakes and JavaScript pull requests for cross-browser compatibility.</p>
	<p>Anyone can get involved with the project through a number of ways. The main one is through the use of GitHub since it is the main repository for the project. It is also the place where issues are tracked. For personal support requests rather than making contributions to the project users can search Stack Overflow, the Slack channel or IRC. Support can also be provided to other users through the last three platforms. </p>
